Ever miss a train stop because you were sleeping or not paying attention?

Well that will never happen again with StopCatcher!

Simply zoom to your stop on the map and enter an estimated countdown time and the app will alert you when you are near the stop or when the timer has run down!

You can now kick back and have a snooze while StopCatcher looks after you!

Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.
